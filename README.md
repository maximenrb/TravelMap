# TravelMap
TravelMap is an application designed to clearly and centrally list all the fountains, but also the bins and toilets available in any city. While having reliable and up-to-date information.

The application will also serve to simplify the work of municipal services, by allowing them to visualise the different points in a city and the problems associated with them.

## Main features
* Real-time interactive maps with fountains, toilets and bins
* Possibility to add new points on the map by users
* User votes: confirmation or set as not found for each point
* Report problems (non-functional or poorly maintained point)
* Management of points and problems for municipal officers
